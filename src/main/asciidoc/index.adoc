== Introduction
This is the Brazilian Beacon API Documentation.


== Certificate API
It is the hash() of a Base 64 encoded PEM formatted file (X.509 ASN.1 1583 encoding), following the RFC 5280 specification,
containing the certificate(s) 1584 of the public counter-part of the Beacon signing key used to produce the
value in the 1585 signatureValue field of the pulse.


=== Get Certificate Id
Obtains a specific certificate by its unique identifier.
